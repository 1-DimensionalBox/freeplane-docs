## How you can contribute

I've listed suggestions from lowest to greatest effort. Any help or other suggestions are appreciated!

1. Add a question to the FAQ

1. Paste a link to a relevant discussion on the Freeplane forum under the correct topic heading in this wiki

1. Copy information from existing Freeplane documentation and paste it under the correct topic heading in this wiki

1. Take screenshots of Freeplane to illustrate relevant topics, put the image files in the `/images` folder in this repo (and even better if you can put links to the images in the correct section of this wiki)

3. Write any amount of text documenting one of the topicsâ€”a how-to, an explanation, a tutorial, or providing reference/technical information about Freeplane. Note: do not worry about grammar. Quickfold will fix writing problems. Feel free to write in your native language and paste the English results from Google Translate or DeepL.com

1. Contact Quickfold or Dimitry to help with the planning, writing, or presentation of the documentation
