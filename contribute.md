# How you can contribute

-----

We are hosting the wiki files at a GitHub repo, but their site does not allow easy styling of the format, full text search of the wiki, or a sidebar to navigate.
Thus, we are using Docsify to provide these features.

We need someone to help style this wiki using Docsify.
Quickfold does not have the technical skills and Dimitry is too busy programming Freeplane.
If you can help, please contact us.

Documentation will be uploaded as it is completed which means that there will be lots of gaps.
Any section headings without documentation are placeholders.
Some sections will have incomplete text, these may contain the phrase "(to be added)" to make clear that we need more content in this section.

I've listed some ways to contribute below, from lowest to greatest effort.
Any help or other suggestions are appreciated!

* Add a question to the FAQ
* Paste a link to a relevant resource (e.g., a discussion on the Freeplane forum, an online video, a web page) under the correct topic heading in this wiki
* Take screenshots of Freeplane to illustrate relevant topics, put the image files in the `/images` folder in this repo (and even better if you can put links to the images in the correct section of this wiki)
* Write any amount of text documenting one of the topicsâ€”a how-to, an explanation, a tutorial, or providing reference/technical information about Freeplane.
  Note: do not worry about grammar.
  Quickfold will fix writing problems.
  Feel free to write in your native language and paste the English results from Google Translate or DeepL.com
* Contact Quickfold or Dimitry to help with the planning, writing, or presentation of the documentation
