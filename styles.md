# Styles

*TODO*

For a style to be available in other mindmaps, it needs to be saved to a [template](templates.md).
Once this is done, the style will be available in each new mindmap created from that template.

There are 2 ways to do it
1. Open the template mindmap and add your new style there.
2. Add a new style to your regular mindmap.
In `Tool panel` â†’ `Make current formatting default`, after setting the properties of your new style, choose `for all mindmaps based on template:` and click `Apply`. 
Use `Choose template` to change the association beforehand, if needed.
