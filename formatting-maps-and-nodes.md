# Formatting maps and nodes

## Map background
There are several options to change the map background: `Format->Map background`

* Background color
* Background image (with the option "fit to window")

## Formatting nodes

The most straightforward way to format a node is to use the formatting toolbar or hot keys, like `Ctrl+B` for bold.

There's also `Tool panel` (right-hand-side panel), which lists all formatting properties that can be set on a node.
It can be opened by right-clicking on the mind map background and selecting `Tool panel`.

In addition to formatting an entire node, it is possible to format each character/word in the node.
It can be done by using the dialog editor `Edit->Node code->Edit node core in dialog (Alt+Enter)`.

?> Note: It's also possible to use the hot keys (e.g. `Ctrl+L` for blue) in the in-line editor.

Finally, a node can be formatted by applying a style to the node â†’ [styles](styles.md)
